AI Development Tooling Notes

This repository documents my hands-on learning and experiments with modern AI-assisted programming tools.

## Focus Areas
- Claude for code reasoning and refactoring
- Cursor / Copilot-assisted development workflows
- Agent-style programming and task decomposition
- Applying AI tools to real-world systems and demos

## Background
I have 15+ years of software engineering experience across testing, development, and systems delivery, including work at Microsoft, IGT, and Airdoc.

This repo serves as a living notebook as I transition into AI-native development workflows.
